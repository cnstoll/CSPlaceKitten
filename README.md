CSPlaceKitten
=============

A place kitten category on top of the awesome UIImageView+AFNetworking category that will automatically place adorable kittens as place holder images on your image views.

CSPlaceKitten leverages both AFNetworking and the free service Placekitten to add an appropriately sized kitten to your UIImageView.

```
